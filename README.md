# MiniVCS

> Because building your own Git teaches you more than using it.

## 📄 Description

**MiniVersionControlSystem** is a lightweight version control system inspired by Git, built from scratch.  
It helps developers understand how version control works internally by recreating the essential building blocks: staging changes, committing snapshots, and maintaining project history.

Unlike a full Git system, **MiniVCS** focuses purely on:

- Tracking file changes
- Creating commit objects
- Managing references
- Storing data using SHA-1 hashes

This project deepens your understanding of repositories, commits, trees, blobs, and refs — the real foundations behind modern version control.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Repository Initialization**: Create a `.minivcs/` hidden folder to store objects and metadata.
- **File Staging**: Hash and store file contents ready for committing.
- **Committing Changes**: Create commits with messages and timestamps linking to staged files.
- **View Commit History**: Traverse through the commit log history.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `os` (file and folder operations)
  - `hashlib` (SHA-1 hashing)
  - `time` (timestamps)
  - `json` (storing staging information)

|-- HEAD # Current branch pointer
|-- index # Staging area (JSON)

### Code organization

minivcs/
|-- core/ # Core functionality
| |-- init.py # Repository setup
| |-- add.py # File hashing and storage
| |-- stage.py # Staging management
| |-- commit.py # Commit creation
| |-- log.py # History viewing

|-- main.py # Command interface

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Initialize a repository
python main.py init

# Add a file
python main.py add filename.txt

# Check staging status
python main.py status

# Commit staged changes
python main.py commit "Initial commit"

# View commit history
python main.py log
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### Content Storage

Files are stored as "blob" objects using SHA-1 hashes of their content, enabling efficient storage where identical content is stored only once.

### Commits and History

Each commit contains:

- A reference to a tree object (snapshot of files)
- A reference to parent commit(s)
- Author information and timestamp
- Commit message

Commits form a chain, with each pointing to its parent, creating a traversable history.

### Staging Area

The staging area (index) tracks which files will be included in the next commit, allowing selective commits of changes.
